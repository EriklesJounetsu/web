At This Project, made by me one and half year ago When i was learning front-end coding, i had in mind an idea about using all content i learned in one single project. I'm commiting this old project to record my studies and my progression. I'll update it, changes in the structure of the code, like using semantic tag from HTML 5 instead of using a lot of DIV's. that's all about this project for now
